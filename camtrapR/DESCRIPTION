Description: Management of and data extraction from camera trap photographs in wildlife studies. The package provides a workflow for storing and sorting camera trap photographs, computes record databases and detection/non-detection matrices for occupancy and spatial capture-recapture analyses with great flexibility. In addition, it provides simple mapping functions (number of species, number of independent species detections by station) and can visualise activity data.
