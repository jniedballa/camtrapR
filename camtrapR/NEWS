Changes in camtrapR 1.2.1 (2019-12-17)
======================================

bugfixes
------------
  o recordTable: fixed error: metadataSpeciesTag must be of class 'character' when it is character and IDfrom = "metadata"
  o recordTable: fixed: 'Error in `[.data.frame`(intable, , match(colnames(record.table), colnames(intable))) :
  undefined columns selected' (when additionalMetadataTags are defined)
  
  new features
------------
  o multi-season sample data sets: camtrapsMultiSeason, recordTableSampleMultiSeason, recordTableIndividualSampleMultiSeason
  
other changes
------------
  o package "data.table" is a dependency now (for more reliable assembly of record table when additionalMetadataTags are defined, see bugfixes)


Changes in camtrapR 1.2 (2019-12-04)
======================================

bugfixes
------------
  o imageRename: fixed bug where fileExistsAlready in output table was FALSE when it should be TRUE

new features
------------
  o detectionHistory: support multi-season input and create detection histories for unmarkedFrameMult (from where users can create multi-season occupancy models with unmarked::colext), new argument "unmarkedFrameMultInput" (developed with support from Kirsten Weingarth)
  o cameraOperation: new argument: sessionCol, to specify trapping sessions / seasons (with some changes to the row names in camera operation matrices if there are session and / or camera information)
  o spatialDetectionHistory: supports camera operation matrices with session information
  o tibbles (tidyverse) or data.tables support: all functions that require input data frames don't throw errors if these are are tibbles or data.tables, instead they automatically convert them to data.frames with a message
  o lubridate support: date and date-time formats as defined by lubridate are now supported (e.g. "ymd" instead of "%Y-%m-%d" or "ymd HMS" instead of "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
  o activityOverlap: main plot title contains species names by default without being specified
  o recordTable / recordTableIndividual: 2 new arguments, "eventSummaryColumn"" and "eventSummaryFunction" for statistics by event (e.g. max count)
  o recordTable / recordTableIndividual: return additional column "n_images" indicating the number of images in an event
  o progress bar in console for all functions that extract image metadata
  o exifTagNames: more flexible, users can define subdirectories by name and give desired file names
  
other changes
------------
  o detectionHistory / spatialDetectionHistory: improved error message if date/time values are not readable (correct row in original recordTable is returned)
  o detectionMaps: new error message when XCol or YCol are not numeric
  o package "rgdal" is no longer a dependency. Function "detectionMaps" will throw an error if user tries to write shapefile but package is missing
  o packages "taxize" and "ritis" are no longer dependencies. Function "checkSpeciesNames" will throw an error if either is missing
  o simplified data format of sample data: only character and numeric/integer in camtraps, recordTableSample, recordTableIndividualSample and timeShiftTable


Changes in camtrapR 1.1
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o appendSpeciesNames / checkSpeciesIdentification / getSpeciesImages: fixed error 'argument "returnFileNamesMissingTags" is missing, with no default'
  o recordTableIndividual: fixed multiple individuals from same image being removed (except for one) when removeDuplicates = TRUE

new features
------------
  o detectionHistory can return counts of records per occasion (new argument "output")
  o activityOverlap can return different overlap estimators (new argument "overlapEstimator")
  o detectionHistory / spatialDetectionHistory: improved error messages when records fall outside camera trap operation range

other changes
------------
  o added citation (see: citation("camtrapR"))
  o added URLs to description


Changes in camtrapR 1.0
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o activityDensity: fixed problem with argument allSpecies = TRUE that caused output list to return values for one species only (reported by Sally Soo).
  o appendSpeciesNames, checkSpeciesIdentification,getSpeciesImages, recordTableIndividual: fixed error in extracting species IDs from image metadata in directories in which no images are tagged. These stations are now skipped with a warning.
  o detectionHistory / spatialDetectionHistory: fixed error with detection histories and effort matrix full of NAs arising if camera operation matrix had values > 2 (after argument camerasIndependent = TRUE in cameraOperation)

other changes
------------
  o imageRename: meaningful error message if no DateTimeOriginal tag was readable (e.g. all cameras were Reconyx HC500)
  o recordTable/ recordTableIndividual: new argument: returnFileNamesMissingTags: file name of images with missing species tag are returned if TRUE (default = FALSE)
  o surveyReport: in sample R script enclosed in survey report zip file, object cameraOperation was renamed to camOp (to avoid the clash with the function name cameraOperation)
  o detectionHistory: the detection history output csv was renamed from record_history... to detection_history...


Changes in camtrapR 0.99.9
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o camera operation: fixed bug with empty entries in cameraCol when cameraCol is defined (reported by Partha Sarathi Ghose)
  o recordTable / recordTableIndividual: verbose warnings and better handling of situations in which date/time is unreadable (empty Exif:DateTimeOriginal metadata tag)

new features
------------
  o detectionHistory / activity plot functions: if date/time is unreadable function returns row IDs to facilitate checks
  o activityDensity: warning instead of error if bandwidth estimation fails and argument allSpecies = TRUE (problem occurred with single records, or few records at similar time of day)

other changes
------------
  o exifTagNames: returns name of image from which metadata were extracted as a message


Changes in camtrapR 0.99.8
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o recordTable / recordTableIndividual: column "HierarchicalSubject" (containing digiKam metadata tags in their native format) was called "record.table3[, col_to_move]" by mistake (thanks to Ross Pitman for reporting)

other changes
------------
  o improved checks that function input has correct class (to make sure data.frames are provided where the functions expect them)

 
Changes in camtrapR 0.99.7
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o recordTable: returned station ID as camera ID if IDfrom = "metadata" and cameraID = "directory"
 
new features
------------
  o detectionMaps: gained argument 'backgroundPolgygon' for plotting a SpatialPolygon object in the background of the maps
  o imageRename: new argument 'createEmptyDirectories' to control whether empty directories should be copied or not
  o imageRename: if outDir contains images already, the function will not stop with an error, but asks you whether or not to copy new images (useful if data come in over time)
  
other changes
------------
  o recordTable / recordTableIndividual: improved handling and reporting of stations without images (warning instead of error)
  o recordTable / recordTableIndividual: improved handling and reporting of stations where all images lack species/individual metadata tags (only if using metadata ID, functions will throw warning instead of error, reported by Aditya Malgaonkar)



Changes in camtrapR 0.99.6
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o fixed crash in cameraOperation function caused by underscores in station / camera IDs (reported by Wyatt Petersen)

new functions
------------
  o fixDateTimeOriginal: Makes DateTimeOriginal Exif metadata tag in Reconyx Hyperfire cameras readable 

new features
------------
  o spatialDetectionHistory: argument 'sessionCol' can now create multi-session capthist objects by either assigning individuals to different sessions or assigning stations to different sessions
  o exifTagNames: gained argument 'returnTagGroup', and now by default returns metadata tag group in addition to metadata tag names (to unambiguously address specific metadata tags)

other changes
------------
  o new dependency: "ritis" - this is because parts of package taxize (used internally by function "checkSpeciesNames") were migrated to ritis
  o detectionHistory / spatialDetectionHistory: occasionLength can be any value between 1 and the number of columns in camOp (not half the number of columns in camOp as before)
  o functions check for spaces in user-provided column names and report them as errors

  
  
Changes in camtrapR 0.99.5
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o recordTable/recordTableIndividual: give warning if Exif DateTimeOriginal tag of images is unreadable (error if all tags of a station are unreadable). May happen if images files are corrupted due to camera malfunctioning.
  o recordTable/recordTableIndividual: 2 records of the same species at the same station and same time by different cameras are not collapsed into one record if camerasIndependent = TRUE
  o all functions using Exiftool: JPG files beginning with "._" are now ignored with a warning (these are hidden, uninformative system files created on Macs and were quite capable of messing up function calls)
  
new features
------------
  o getSpeciesImages can now also read image file paths from a record table provided by the user instead of reading species IDs anew in every function call. It gained 3 new arguments for that purpose.
  o recordTable and recordTableIndividual both gained an argument (removeDuplicateRecords) to control whether duplicate records (same station, same species, exactly same time) should be collapsed into one record (former versions did that without asking)
  
other changes
------------
  o imageRename will first check all directories before actually renaming anything. So the function won't break halfway through, leaving you with a half-full directory of renamed images if something goes wrong (e.g. unreadable date/time tags).
  
  
  
Changes in camtrapR 0.99.4
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o spatialDetectionHistory: trap usage now codes malfunctioning cameras and cameras that were not set up as 0 instead of NA (as expected by the secr package)
  o spatialDetectionHistory: argument "scaleEffort" can only be FALSE now (to avoid negative trapping effort values, which secr does not accept)
  
new features
------------
  o spatialDetectionHistory gained argument "sessionCol". It can be used to split data (i.e., create a list with multiple capthist objects) if captures come from different sessions).
  
other changes
------------
  o package shows startup message and checks automatically if local package version is up to date

  

Changes in camtrapR 0.99.3
==========================

new functions
------------
  o addCopyrightTag: Write a copyright tag into image Exif metadata

bugfixes
------------
  o detectionHistory: malfunctioning cameras (0 in camera operation matrix) did not cause detection history matrix cells to be NA (even if includeEffort = FALSE; reported by Hsiang Ling Chen)
  o detectionHistory: if the last occasion is shorter than occasionLength, the corresponding detection history matrix cells will now be NA if includeEffort = FALSE
  o surveyReport: species column names other than "Species" are now supported, i.e. argument "speciesCol" is now respected (thanks to Valentine Herrmann and Stefano Anile for reporting)

new features
------------
  o detectionHistory gained argument "minActiveDaysPerOccasion". It can be used to define the minimum number of active trap days per occasion for that occasion be included (0/1 instead of NA)
  
  
  
Changes in camtrapR 0.99.2
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o recordTable: fixed problem with appending camera IDs
  o cameraOperation: improved messages to user

other changes
------------
  o added section about defining date formats in camera station table to vignette 1 (Image Organisation)


  
Changes in camtrapR 0.99.1
==========================

bugfixes
------------
  o detectionHistory and spatialDetectionHistory did not run correctly under some rare circumstances (combinations of input arguments)
  o column names of detection histories were incorrect if occasionStartTime != 0 and datesAsOccasionNames = TRUE
  o argument maxNumberDays in detectionHistory / spatialDetectionHistory works on each station individually if day1 = "survey" or "station"; and from the specified date if day1 is a date

other changes
------------
  o additional checks for consistency of input in a number of functions
  o code simplification invisible to the user

  

Changes in camtrapR 0.99.0
==========================

new functions
------------
  o checkSpeciesNames: checks a vector of species names (common or scientific) against the ITIS taxonomic database via package 'taxize'
  o checkSpeciesIdentification: expanded from former function checkSpeciesFolders (now defunct). Can check identification if metadata tags were used for species identification. 
  o createStationFolders: Create camera trap station directories, possibly with camera subdirectories, for storing raw images (was not included in NAMESPACE of version 0.98.0, therefore invisible. Thanks to Patrick Lorch and Brent Pease for notification)

  o recordDatabaseIndividual -> recordTableIndividual
  
renamed data sets
------------

  o argument "hasCameraSubfolders" was renamed to "hasCameraFolders" (functions appendSpeciesNames, checkSpeciesIdentification, createSpeciesFolders, imageRename, timeShiftImages)
  o in all 4 activity plot functions, argument "all.species" was renamed to "allSpecies"
  o argument "recordTable" in spatialDetectionHistory was renamed to "recordTableIndividual" to make the difference from "recordTable" in "detectionHistory" clearer
