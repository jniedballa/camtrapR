\usage{
\S4method{predict}{commOccu}(
  object,
  mcmc.list,
  type,
  draws = 1000,
  level = 0.95,
  interval = c("none", "confidence"),

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{commOccu} object}

\item{mcmc.list}{mcmc.list. Output of \code{fit} called on a \code{commOccu} object}

\item{type}{character. "psi" for species occupancy estimates, "richness" for species richness estimates, "pao" for percentage of area occupied (by species), "psi_array" for raw occupancy probabilities in an array. For Royle-Nichols models, "abundance" for species abundance, or "lambda_array" for raw species abundance estimates in an array.}

\item{draws}{Number of draws from the posterior to use when generating the plots. If fewer than draws are available, they are all used}

\item{level}{Probability mass to include in the uncertainty interval}

\item{interval}{Type of interval calculation. Can be "none" or "confidence" (can be abbreviated). Calculation can be slow for type = "psi" with many cells and posterior samples.}

\item{x}{SpatRaster or data.frame. Must be scaled with same parameters as site covariates used in model, and have same names.}

\item{aoi}{SpatRaster with same dimensions as x (if x is a SpatRaster), indicating the area of interest (all cells with values are AOI, all NA cells are ignored). If NULL, predictions are made for all cells.}

\item{speciesSubset}{species to include in richness estimates. Can be index number or species names.}

\item{batch}{logical or numeric. If FALSE, all raster cells / data frame rows will be processed at once (can be memory intensive). If TRUE, computation is conducted in batches of 1000. If numeric, it is the desired batch size.}

\item{seed}{numeric. Seed to use in \code{set.seed} for reproducible results (ensures that \code{draws} are identical).}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster or data.frame, depending on \code{x}. If type = "pao", a list. If type = "psi_array" or "lambda_array", a 3D-array [cell, species, draw].
}
\description{
Create (spatial) predictions of species occupancy and species richness from community occupancy models and spatial rasters or covariate data frames.
}
\details{
Processing can be very memory-intensive. If memory is insufficient, use the  \code{batch} parameter. This can enable processing for higher numbers of \code{draws} or very large rasters / data frames.
